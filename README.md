# K_Means_Clustering

Created the K-means clustering algorithm without using any built in clustering functions, to demonstrate how the algorithm works. I also created a function that saves all of the cluster assignments and centroids for every iteration. This function was used to create an animated visualization of the clustering algorithm iteration by iteration.
